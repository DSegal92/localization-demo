A friend of mine is getting his masters in translation, and wanted to
demonstrate in one of his classes the process of localizing an application.

Since it'd be difficult to get a bunch of completely non-technical people
up to speed with an actual application within a class period, he asked if
I could make a "simulator" that lets them see the core experience of
adding resources and associating them in code.

As a web developer foremost, I don't have any experience offhand building
Android views in code so I apologize for any/ all egregious errors, but
just making a file that _looks_ like an Android view was the goal.

The end result is available at: https://dsegal92.github.io/localization-demo/
